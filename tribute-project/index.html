        Chester Charles Bennington was an American singer, songwriter, musician,
        and actor. He was best known as the lead vocalist for Linkin Park and
        was also lead vocalist for the bands Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise and,
        between 2013 and 2015, Stone Temple Pilots. Bennington has been credited
        by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his
        generation.<br />
        Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release
        of Linkin Park's debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide
        commercial success.<br />
        On July 20, 2017, Bennington was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes
        Estates, California; his death was ruled a suicide by hanging. Hit
        Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the
        "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time". Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss
        stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal".

      “What’s the worst thing I’ve stolen? Probably little pieces of other
      people’s lives. Where I’ve either wasted their time or hurt them in some
      way. That’s the worst thing you can steal, the time of other people. You
      just can’t get that back.”
